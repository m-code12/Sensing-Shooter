# Sensing-Shooter
Sensing-Shooter is a combination of software and hardware  components such as Bluetooth module, Arduino Uno, PIR sensor and their respective codes were used. This project was designed with a view of providing instant security to the border which can reduce casualties.

COMPONENTS & SOFTWARE :
-> OV7670 Camera module
-> PIR sensor
-> L298N Motor Driver
-> DC motor 3-6V
-> Bluetooth Module
-> Chassis
-> Jumper Cables
-> DC motor 12V
-> Batteries
-> Arduino UNO board,Breadboard
-> Software: Java and Arduino IDE

Working :
PIR will sense the presence of the target.
Camera will be used to check if the target ahead needs to be shot .
Once confirmed by the user, the bot will shoot the target.
The motion of the bot is controlled using Bluetooth module.

FUTURE SCOPE :
-> This model can be used for border security.
-> Better functionality at Border
-> Help to soldiers 
-> Improved security
-> Reduces chance of enemy to enter
